Requirements
========================
    1. Python 3.x
    2. Pip

Once you have installed Python & Pip we must install the whole dependencies for the project.

### Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Inside working directory we have the main Python script and configuration file.

### Configuration File  - settings.ini
If you want to change the url base where we must download the files or add/remove years , 
you should change this behavior inside settings.ini

```
cd livestories directory 
python download_and_process.py
```

## Run the solution

```
 python download_and_process.py
```
